<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
    I am a detail-oriented scientific software engineer with 4+ years of experience engineering software solutions to tackle complex research problems in geographic information systems, remote sensing, and image processing for space missions.
</p>
    I have substantial experience working in multidisciplinary teams composed of analysts, researchers, and engineers on long-term, open-ended projects. I am highly adaptable and committed to lifelong learning and research impact. I have demonstrated skill in designing, developing, and improving the performance and scalability of planetary data analysis tools and data product pipelines. I am continuously expanding my knowledge of the state of the art in scientific computing, and I am eager to apply this knowledge to challenging research software engineering roles.
