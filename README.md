<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
    I am a software developer with particular interest in scientific computing.
</p>

<p>
    I am skilled in a variety of programming languages and technologies with a focus on Python and C++. I also have substantial domain knowledge in GIS and image processing for remote sensing applications in space missions, as well as experience working in multidisciplinary teams composed of analysts, researchers, and other developers on long-term, open-ended projects.
</p>

<p>
    I am adaptable and continuously expanding my knowledge of the state of the art when it comes to scientific computing, and I am eager to apply this knowledge to challenging research software engineering roles.
